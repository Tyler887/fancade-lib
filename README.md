# fancade-lib
Library of Fancade games, using HTML.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of issues and PRs.
### Embedded versions
I do not recommend that you embed urls starting with `tyler887.github.io/fancade-lib` since there may be text poping up on the html. I recommend you embed the `play.fancade.com` domain to embed a Fancade game. This example is an embed version of Drive Mad:
```html
<iframe id="fancade" src="https://play.fancade.com/5F084A0BCE06B710?max_w=2800&max_h=2800" frameborder="0" height="100%" width="100%" title=Drive Mad â€¢ Play online"></iframe> 
```
